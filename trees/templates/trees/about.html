        <h3>🌱 Why Trees Matter</h3>
        <p>Trees are essential for life on Earth. They produce oxygen, absorb carbon dioxide, provide habitat
            for wildlife, prevent soil erosion, and offer countless resources for human use. Understanding
            and protecting trees is understanding and protecting our future.</p>
