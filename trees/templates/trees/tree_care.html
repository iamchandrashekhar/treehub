            <h3>🌸 Spring Care</h3>
            <p>Spring is the perfect time for planting new trees, applying fertilizer if needed,
                and inspecting for winter damage. Remove any dead or damaged branches and
                prepare your trees for the growing season.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>☀️ Summer Care</h3>
            <p>Focus on proper watering during hot, dry periods. Deep, infrequent watering
                is best. Monitor for pests and diseases, and avoid pruning most tree species
                during active growth periods.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>🍂 Fall Care</h3>
            <p>Fall is ideal for planting in many regions and for major pruning of deciduous trees.
                Rake and compost fallen leaves, and consider applying mulch before winter arrives.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>❄️ Winter Care</h3>
            <p>Protect young trees from harsh winter conditions with tree wraps or guards.
                Avoid walking on frozen ground around trees, and gently brush heavy snow
                from branches to prevent breakage.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="card-grid">
        <div class="card">
            <h3>📍 Location Selection</h3>
            <p>Choose a location with appropriate sunlight, soil conditions, and space for
                the tree's mature size. Consider proximity to buildings, power lines, and other trees.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>🕳️ Proper Planting</h3>
            <p>Dig a hole twice as wide as the root ball but no deeper. The top of the root
                ball should be level with or slightly above the surrounding soil surface.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>💧 Initial Watering</h3>
            <p>Water thoroughly after planting and maintain consistent moisture for the first
                year. Newly planted trees need regular watering to establish strong root systems.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>🌱 Early Care</h3>
            <p>Stake only if necessary and remove stakes after one year. Apply mulch around
                the base and monitor for signs of stress during the establishment period.</p>
