            <h3>🌬️ Air Purification</h3>
            <p>Forests act as the Earth's lungs, absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen.
                They also filter pollutants from the air, improving air quality for all living beings.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>💧 Water Cycle</h3>
            <p>Trees play a crucial role in the water cycle by absorbing rainwater, reducing
                runoff, preventing erosion, and releasing water vapor through transpiration.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>🦋 Biodiversity</h3>
            <p>Forests are home to 80% of terrestrial biodiversity. They provide habitat,
                food, and shelter for countless species of plants, animals, and microorganisms.</p>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>🌡️ Climate Regulation</h3>
            <p>Forests help regulate global climate by storing carbon, moderating temperatures,
                and influencing precipitation patterns across different regions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>🏞️ Natural Resources</h3>
            <p>Forests provide essential resources including timber, medicinal plants, food,
                and materials while supporting the livelihoods of millions of people worldwide.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>🧘 Human Wellbeing</h3>
